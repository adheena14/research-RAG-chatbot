# research-RAG-chatbot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that reads, understands, and answers questions from research papers. This project extracts text from PDF research papers, embeds the content using Sentence Transformers, stores it in a FAISS vector database, and uses an LLM to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
